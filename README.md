## Project Description 🩺
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early detection can significantly improve the quality of life and survival rates. This project uses a variety of health-related features to predict whether an individual has heart disease or not. Using machine learning models, we analyze patterns in the data to assist medical professionals in making more informed decisions.

## Dataset 📋
The dataset used in this project contains information about individuals’ health characteristics and heart disease status. It includes the following features:

### Features 🧑‍⚕️
1. **Age:** The age of the individual.
2. **Gender:** The gender of the individual.
3. **Blood Pressure:** The individual’s blood pressure levels.
4. **Cholesterol Level:** The levels of cholesterol (both HDL and LDL) in the individual's blood.
5. **Exercise Habits:** The frequency of exercise undertaken by the individual.
6. **Smoking:** Whether the individual smokes or not.
7. **Family Heart Disease:** Whether the individual has a family history of heart disease.
8. **Diabetes:** Whether the individual has diabetes.
9. **BMI:** The body mass index of the individual, indicating whether they are overweight or underweight.
10. **High Blood Pressure:** Whether the individual has high blood pressure.
11. **Low HDL Cholesterol:** Whether the individual has low levels of HDL cholesterol.
12. **High LDL Cholesterol:** Whether the individual has high levels of LDL cholesterol.
13. **Alcohol Consumption:** The individual’s alcohol consumption habits.
14. **Stress Level:** The level of stress experienced by the individual.
15. **Sleep Hours:** The number of hours the individual sleeps on average per night.
16. **Sugar Consumption:** The individual’s sugar consumption levels.
17. **Triglyceride Level:** The levels of triglycerides in the individual’s blood.
18. **Fasting Blood Sugar:** The individual’s fasting blood sugar level.
19. **CRP Level:** The C-reactive protein levels in the individual’s blood, which may indicate inflammation.
20. **Homocysteine Level:** The homocysteine level in the individual’s blood, which can indicate the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

### Target Variable 🎯
The target variable is **Heart Disease Status** with two possible values:
- **No:** The individual does not have heart disease.
- **Yes:** The individual has been diagnosed with heart disease.

## Modeling Approach 🤖
The project uses machine learning algorithms to predict heart disease status based on the provided features. Here are the main steps followed in the project:

1. **Data Preprocessing** 🧹:
   - Handle missing values, if any.
   - Encode categorical features.
   - Normalize or scale numerical features.

2. **Model Selection** 📚:
   - Several classification algorithms can be used for this task, including:
     - Random Forest Classifier (RFC) 🌲
     - Logistic Regression 📈
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM) 🧑‍💻

3. **Model Evaluation** 📊:
   - Models are evaluated using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning** ⚙️:
   - Hyperparameters of the selected models are tuned using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
